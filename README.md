Node.js is required to run this sample application. You can download the installer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Clone this repository and switch to that directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:Gentrack/webhook-sample-js.git ~/webhook-app
cd ~/webhook-app
```

Start a development server with the following command:
```
node app.js
```

Your application is now listening at port 3001 and can process requests posted to `/webhook`.
